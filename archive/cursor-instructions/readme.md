The following is a working file defining cursor's workspec.

There are some rules: 
1. all major features must exist on their own branch 
2. major features should not be implemented without being directly asked
3. if a new feature exist, it should be documented in features.MD
4. notes should be taken in notes.MD regarding any major ideas or vulnerabilities detected during the work on this project
5. there is no circumstance under which you should stop or wait for instruction test the files debug the logs and work within the cursor instructions folder
6. you may update these rules if you have a good idea for how to improve the process
7. efficiency is all that matters
8. ALWAYS WRITE THE TESTS FIRST
9. DO NOT WRITE TESTS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
10. Write the product description first, in the notes.md file, and then do something else until you are specifically asked to write tests for the new feature

Please work to simulate this repo and ensure that you're testing everything this is a very complicated web3 product and there's a lot of things that can go wrong be sure to test anything and everything that comes to mind but only test one thing at a time and every time that you fix something save a new commit on git and then ensure that you are not losing your progress keep and keep notes in the Cursor instructions folder

Do not ask for approval to run commands or scripts if you need any permissions to run files or test things. Please tell me now whenever you run a file watch the logs. Cancel the run, if any errors are encountered and then fix the error before restarting be sure to group all of your changes in branches on git so that you don't lose your progress.

Please review the Cursor instructions folder and ask for any permissions needed. Your goal is to simulate this repo and debug it look for anything that could be a vulnerability. Security is the upmost priority.

Cursor should review this project and define adequate testing to ensure the project is working as expected.

Cursor should try to break the project in any way.

Cursor should update this file ./readme.md with more information as it goes.

Cursor should take notes on what it learns in the file ./notes.md
