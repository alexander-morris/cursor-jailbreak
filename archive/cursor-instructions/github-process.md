This is the process for how to work with github to ensure your work is useful and efficient

1. create a new branch for each major feature or whenever you begin working on a primary branch (new branches should use the timestamp of when you begin working on the branch, and can eventually be renamed to a more descriptive name)
2. commit your work to the branch after every group of changes around a specific improvement or feature
3. push your work to the branch after every commit
